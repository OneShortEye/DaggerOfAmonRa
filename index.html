  <p>
    The art changed significantly from the floppy to CD version. This gallery shows off the differences. There's something to find on every screen!

  </h3>
  <p>
    The game came with a sixty-page museum guide, full of neat art and articles, written as if it were a real museum guide. This is a high-quality scan of my personal copy.

  <p>
    The game also included a flyer with a map of the museum. Note how "Egyptian" is misspelled on the front. This document also contains part of the "Additional Instructions" in the game box.

    This is the version of the flyer that came with the CD version. It has a slightly different layout.
